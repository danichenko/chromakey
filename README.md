Introduction
============

chromakey is gphoto2-based software to take preview pictures from camera and replace contrast green background with predefined image.

Basic steps
===========
Will be realized in near future:

 * capture preview from camera to memory
 * process in-memory preview to strip out chroma key background
 * merge with predefined image
 * capture full-size image when ready (on keyboard action first?)

Advanced steps
==============
Will be realized after basic steps will be completed:
 * using remote control to capture full-size image
 * moving and resizing images (with RC actions?)
